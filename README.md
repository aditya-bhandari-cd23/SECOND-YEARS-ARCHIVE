This repository contains RVCE's first year notes and question papers for the 2022 scheme. The courses are exclusive to the CS-allied branches (CSE, CD, CY, ISE, AIML). If you are new to Github, you better learn it first as being a CS student requires you to be familiar with Git and GitHub. For now just download the ZIP file (~1.1 GB).
